The final year project is the culmination of your degree programme. It allows you to work on a substantial problem in Computer Science for an extended period of time. It allows you to demonstrate your competence as a computer science professional, and to apply what you have learnt in the other components of your degree.

Unlike the 40-credit Computer Science project 17419, this 60-credit project demands that you demonstrate a broader range of the most advanced skills required at MSc level. Further, the 60-credit module requires the submission of additional assessment material. This project is suitable for exceptionally independent and self-motivated students.

All project modules test your ability to:
* carry out a substantial problem solving task of your own choosing;
work independently, and to prioritise different components of your project, as well as prioritising the project as a whole against other work;
* take decisions, and to justify them convincingly.
* It is your responsibility to lead your project, to arrange your supervision meetings and to ask for the advice that you need.

The project is an opportunity to demonstrate problem solving skills. It must include a substantial piece of scientific or engineering work.

The project can be in any area of Computer Science including Artificial Intelligence, Graphics, Human-Computer Interaction, Image Processing, Mobile, Natural Computation, Robotics, Security, Software Engineering or Theory. The project will involve programming, software or hardware development, mathematical proof, empirical investigation, or some other scientific or engineering method, as applied to Computer Science.

The project will NOT consist of only a literature review.

This 60 credit project allows a student to conduct an in-depth exploration of advanced computional concepts (that would not be possible in a 40 credit module). In addition, this module has an additional assessment criteria. The student must present a literature review and preliminary results in the style of a scientific magazine article, e.g. Communications of the ACM, as directed by the supervisor.

Many projects consist of designing and writing a substantial piece of software (software development projects). Such a project will typically include:

* considering user requirements
* producing a specification
* designing a software system to meet the specification
* implementing and testing the software
* evaluating the end-product.

Projects that use other engineering methods may have other requirements.

During the project you will need to evaluate alternative approaches and solutions to problems. It is important that you document these decisions as they should form a substantial part of your Project Report.

This project module is worth 60 credits which requires about 600 hours of work, including background reading and assessment.

This document is structured as a timeline. The sections are ordered according to the major events that you will face as you prepare for and conduct your final year project.
