# Scientific Article
The article, in the style of a scientific article, should include a literature review and a description of the preliminary project work. 

## Scientific Paper assessment
You have to produce a scientific article at the end of the first semester.  This should be written in the style of a ‘work-in-progress’ conference paper, formatted appropriately.
 

There is a page limit of 8 pages minimum, 12 pages target (i.e. the ideal), 16 pages maximum (excluding references).
  
It will contribute 10% of the final mark.

It should read like an academic paper, and, given the state of the project, will provide:
* abstract
* introduction
* related work/literature review
* problem details

It will then either have depth in the literature review, or will develop the methodological approach, experimental design, or theoretical angles taken to address the problem, and It will be assessed like any other academic paper, according to the standards embodied in the report marking criteria.

Assessment will take account of the fact that the project is only half-complete, so results and detailed discussions are unlikely to feature in the report; structured information, hypotheses, concepts, ideas and approaches are more likely.  Note that where appropriate, full marks can be obtained for something that is a comprehensive, structured, effective literature review of the domain.

For staff: Essentially, this means that colleagues can assess the paper according to their usual criteria for assessing early-stage work reported at conferences, and/or literature reviews, with the given marking criteria to ensure consistency.
